# Housing Insecurity Dashboard
## Visualizations
**Yearly data from 2010 until 2016 is displayed at once without being able to look at more detailed data intervals. This is because our data contained data on individuals once for each year and our census data is also reported once each year.**

**All visualizations show information on 'Sheltered Homeless' and 'Unsheltered Homeless' individuals. The side-By-side bar charts and the line graph also show totals (Sheltered Homeless + Unsheltered Homeless) for each year.**

### **Value (%) Side-By-Side Bar Chart**   
Shows percentage of unsheltered and sheltered homeless individuals for year selected and either for all states or for those selected in the State Stacked Bar Chart.

### **Yearly Count Line Graph**   
Shows the count of unsheltered and sheltered homeless individuals for year selected and either for all states or for those selected in the State Stacked Bar Chart.

### **State Stacked Bar Chart**   
Shows stacked ratio of sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals for each state based on the year selected.
