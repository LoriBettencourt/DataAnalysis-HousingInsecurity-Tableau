## Personal Case Study
For over 20 years, I lived in an area where it was not generally obvious that there was any significant number of residents without shelter. I would see demographics for some of my students, however, that would identify these individuals as "homeless", and this had always sparked some curiosity and compassion in me. This led me listen to the podcast ["According to Need"](https://99percentinvisible.org/need/) by reporter Katie Mingle.  

Since listening to that podcast, I have moved to a small city where I routinely see people in the same clothes day-after-day, sleeping in the park, and gathering in groups in the same area to have some company while they pass the time.

## Analysis Task
Let's look specifically at housing insecurity trends from 2010 until 2016: 
1. Which years had the highest and lowest homelessness percentages of the U.S. Population.
What are the overall trends of housing insecurity among sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals?
2. What are the two peak years for the homelessness count in the U.S.?
3. Between which two years did homelessness change the most drastically in the U.S.?
4. Which states have the highest overall count of homeless individuals (not considering population here).
